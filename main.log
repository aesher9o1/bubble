You have passed task=transcribe, but also have set `forced_decoder_ids` to [[1, None], [2, 50360]] which creates a conflict. `forced_decoder_ids` will be ignored in favor of task=transcribe.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.

ref_text   Some days, the weight of exhaustion holds me down so heavy that even the smallest tasks feel overwhelming. I didn't feel like doing anything today, no energy, no motivation. 
gen_text 0 "Ring, ring! Vern. Florida-bound, leaves a paper trail. T-stop, pause his paper. Next caller, delivery delay - wildlife interference. Porcupine on the paper tube, ridiculous!
gen_text 1 Ring, ring! Judy. Staying town-bound, grandkids growing, health declining. Ring, ring! A woman, two kids, asks for November 15th papers. Looking up, ten dollars on the counter.
gen_text 2 'Stop my mother’s paper.' 'Judy Willis?' Confusion. She was staying in town... 'No...no.' Grief washes over her. 'Cancel her subscription.
gen_text 3 My mother has passed away...' Shivers down my spine. November 15th... The date on Judy’s obituary."
